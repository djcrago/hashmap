In this project I...

- Created a hashmap algorithm which utilizes linked lists
- Practiced hashing and using hash codes
- Learned about buckets and deepended my understanding of linked lists
- Developed a method to overwrite prior values of the same key
- Developed a method to dynamically increase the capacity of a bucket (even though it's not technically necessary in JavaScript);
- Practiced accessing and modifying linked lists
- Refactored a key:value-pair hashMap class into a key-only hashSet class
